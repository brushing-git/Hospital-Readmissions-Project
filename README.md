# Hospital-Readmissions

## Overview

Machine learning models offer the ability to make predictions about future events from past records.  By learning patterns in data, a model can generate informed guesses that often exceed chance and even the predictions of human subject matter experts.  With this project, I worked with a team of fellow University of California, Irvine graduate students to build a series of machine learning algorithms that predict the probability diabetes patients might be readmitted to hospital.  This demonstrates my facility with **data grooming, data manipulation, model training, model evaluation, model improvement, model selection, and data science teamwork**.

This project is directly relevant to any organization that has extensive records and wants to extract predictions from those records.  Those predictions could be useful for modifying future plans.  For example, this project deals with predicting hospital readmissions.  It would be directly relevant for doctors, hospital administrators, insurance companies, and patients themselves to know patient risks for readmission.  Using that knowledge could allow for precautions to be taken to reduce those risks.

The machine learning methods that myself and my teammates employed include **linear classifiers, decision trees, neural networks, and random forests**.  These are all examples of **supervised learning**, where models are trained like students at school based on their ability to give correct answers and learn from their mistakes.  We estimated model accuracy with **ROC-AUC** and performed model evaluation via **K-fold cross-validation**.  The software we used included **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, jupyter notebook, scikit-learn, and pytorch**.

My project teammates were [Kate Deyneka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edeyneka/) and [Brian Tran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-d-tran/).  **The contributions I provided in the project include help with data grooming and manipulation and sole work on linear classifiers and neural networks.**  I also helped author our final report.
